# Economic Policy Project
This repository contains the R code used to reproduce my visualisations for an Economic Policy project I produced on while undertaking my Master of Science in Economics at the University of Edinburgh.

The project was titled "The Impact of Chinaâ€™s Economic Sanctions on Australian Exports"
